# Installation

The package targets Python `>=3.10,<3.11` and depends on the Scanpy single-cell
analysis stack. The repository includes both a conda environment file and a
standard editable Python package setup.

## Conda Environment

From the repository root:

```bash
conda env remove -n sctl
conda env create -f sctl.yaml
conda activate sctl
```

The conda environment installs the package in editable mode through the `pip`
section of [`sctl.yaml`](../sctl.yaml).

## Editable Install

If the Scanpy stack is already available in your active environment:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Verify Import

```bash
python -c "import single_cell_python_tools as sctl; print(sctl.__all__)"
```

The package import requires dependencies such as `scanpy`, `anndata`, `gseapy`,
`leidenalg`, and `bbknn` to be installed.
