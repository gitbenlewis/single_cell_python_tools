# Troubleshooting

## Import Fails With Missing Scanpy

`single_cell_python_tools` imports the Scanpy stack. If import fails with
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scanpy'`, create and activate the conda
environment from [`sctl.yaml`](../sctl.yaml), or install the dependencies listed
in [`pyproject.toml`](../pyproject.toml).

## Python Version Mismatch

The package metadata currently requires Python `>=3.10,<3.11`. Use the
repository conda environment when possible.

## Notebook Cannot Find The Package

Install the package in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

For path-based notebook work, add the parent directory that contains the package
repository to `sys.path` before importing `single_cell_python_tools`.

## Output Directories Are Missing

For `DATASET_class` workflows, check the output-related parameters and call
`make_output_dirs_if_not_exist()` before steps that write figures or tables.

## Links In Published Docs Go To GitHub

The docs hub deliberately links notebooks, example data, generated tables, and
source files to GitHub instead of copying them into the Pages build.
